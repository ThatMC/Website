# Website

I would like to personally thank you for your interest on my work.

This is a free resource.
While you are ABSOLUTELY free to edit ANY file and ANY line of the code, you are not allowed to remove my name from the footer.
I'm supporting you; I'd appreciate it if you did the same.

The aim of this website is to provide Minecraft owners a fully responsive, modern and elegant website without the need to hire a website developer and pay money for it.
It is excessively easy to modify, when all you have to do to make it functional is edit the config.js (more information on the Configuration section below).

It includes:
Server IP on a visible place.
Discord widget.
Announcements
No PHP, can run on every browser or server with no problems.
Excessively easy to modify.
Quick support
Font Awesome's awesome icons.

I will be more than happy to answer to your questions and fix some small bugs at no cost.

As I said, this homepage is free to use but you will have to keep my name on the footer.
If you, for any reason, want to remove my name from there, it would cost $2.50 dollars.

Proof of ownership:
This is the website I created for my Minecraft server and decided to share it.
