I would like to personally thank you for your interest on my work.

This is a free copy of the resource.
While you are ABSOLUTELY free to edit ANY file and ANY line of the website, you are not allowed to remove my name from the footer.
I'm supporting you. I'd appreciate it if you did the same.

*** Configuration ***
Most of the content is configurable and you only have to edit the file index.html or config.js which is located at:
/js/config.js
/index.thml

*** Support ***
I will be more than happy to answer to your questions and fix some small bugs at no cost.
